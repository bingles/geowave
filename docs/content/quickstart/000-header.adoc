= GeoWave Quickstart

The GeoWave quickstart guide is designed to allow a new user to run through a few simple use cases with the GeoWave framework using the Command-Line Interface.  While this guide uses a local key/value store, a version of the guide is available link:quickstart-emr.html[here, window="_blank"] which utilizes EMR on AWS.
